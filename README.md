The entity relational diagram displays the relationships the tables might share when the SQL database gets defined and implemented. There is a USER entity that handles the authentication details of the auction system. Every user that is created in the database also gets populated in the CUSTOMER table and the SELLER table. The CUSTOMER table requires a bit more information from the user such as their address, billing address, and their cred card information, for security and payment reasons.
